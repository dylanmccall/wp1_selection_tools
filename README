This tool allows to easily build non-topic centric selections of
Wikipedia articles.

== Requirements ==

To run it, you need:
* MANDATORY: a GNU/Linux system
* MANDATORY: an access to Internet
* MANDATORY: an access to a Wikipedia database
* OPTION: an access to enwp10 rating database for Wikipedia in English

== Context ==

Many Wikipedias, in different languages, are over 500.000 articles and
even if we can provide offline versions with a reasonnable size, this
is still too much for many devices. That's why we need to build
offline versions with only a selections with the TOP best articles.

== Principle ==

This tool builds lists of key values (pageviews, links, ...) about
Wikipedia articles an put them in a directory. One time all this key
values are gathered, they are upload to http://wp1.kiwix.org/. These
key values are everything we have as input to build smart selection
algorithms. To get more detalis about the list, read the README in the
language based directory.

== Tools ==

* build_biggest_wikipedia_list.sh give you the list of all
  wikipedia/languages with more than 500.000 entries.

* build_selections.sh takes a language code ('en' for example) as first
  argument and create the directory with all the key values.

* build_all_selections.sh to build/upload lists for all Wikipedia with
  more than 500.000 pages.
